# ðŸ‘” Scaler Learners Clustering â€“ Job Role & Salary Segmentation

This case study focuses on segmenting learners from **Scaler** based on their job profiles, roles, and salaries using **unsupervised clustering techniques**. The goal was to identify patterns in learner career outcomes and group similar job profiles together for better understanding of career clusters.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Covers

- Cleaned and prepared learner job data (domain, role, experience, salary)
- Applied **label encoding** to handle categorical features like role and domain
- Scaled features using **StandardScaler**
- Used **KMeans Clustering** to segment learners into distinct groups
- Determined optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**
- Analyzed and interpreted each clusterâ€™s characteristics

## âœ… Key Insights

The clustering revealed distinct learner segments based on job role, domain, and salary â€” highlighting patterns that Scaler can turn into strategic advantages.

From a business perspective, Scaler can:

- **Use high-salary learner clusters as a USP** by comparing them with industry averages and showcasing them in marketing campaigns
- **Trace back top earners' platform behavior** (e.g., PSP scores, mock interviews, module test performance) to identify success-driving habits â€” and build them into the learning experience for future learners
- **Spot potential high performers early** and match them with top-tier job openings â€” improving both learner outcomes and hiring partner satisfaction
